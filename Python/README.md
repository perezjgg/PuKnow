## Rock type characterization

- About the dataset: the core_analysis.csv file contains 240 core samples analysis with porosity and permeability values.

- Problem: How we can make a rock-type quality classification in a short time to do reservoir engineering analysis?

- Solution approach: Using clustering machine learning methods we can classify the reservoir rock types
